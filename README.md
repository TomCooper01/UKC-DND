Made when Tom and Sam got drunk...

run on raptor so people can all connect

player class: health, stats, inventory, abilities, hunger
stats: endurance, strength, agility, autism level, 
if name is alex bag, max stats from the start
autism: higher level = less map awareness (when moved, move the distance asked plus a random
        integer, proportional to the autism)
        when opening the bag, you randomly lose items, and you take an extra turn to search the bag
        (other poeple dont use a turn)
        strength proportional to autism
        when the stat goes above a certian threshold, you become a mob and can hurt your teammates
inventory: collect bags, decides inventory size/weight capacity, also stats affect this.

map: canterbury campus (including parkwood).
